## Instructions

* Simply create a copy of this template repository by clicking [here](https://github.com/new?template_name=readme-repo-pins&template_owner=r055a)
  * name the new repository `Repository name*` identical to the `owner*` name.
  * select the green `Create Repository` button.

This creates a GitHub profile with frequently updated repo pins using CI automation and a placeholder:

`<!-- START/END: REPO-PINS -->`

The text in this repository is removed so that profiles only display the generated repository pins and other content
added outside the placeholder. There is no further setup requirement for the profile repository and its automation.
<!-- END: REPO-PINS -->
